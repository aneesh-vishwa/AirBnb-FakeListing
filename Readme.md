# Airbnb Fake Listing Detection

A machine learning-powered solution for identifying potentially fraudulent or fake listings on Airbnb-style platforms. This project implements various classification algorithms to analyze listing characteristics, host behavior patterns, and property details to flag suspicious listings that may indicate fraud or misrepresentation.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Online marketplaces like Airbnb face significant challenges with fraudulent listings that can harm both guests and the platform's reputation. This project addresses this critical issue by developing a robust machine learning system that can automatically detect suspicious listings before they impact users.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Algorithm Approach**: Implements multiple classification algorithms including Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression
- **Comprehensive Feature Analysis**: Analyzes listing characteristics, host behavior patterns, and property details
- **Real-time Detection**: Designed to evaluate listings against hundreds of risk signals
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle large-scale data processing
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tuned models for maximum accuracy and minimal false positives

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Fraudulent Airbnb listings pose significant risks including:
- Financial losses for guests
- Safety concerns from non-existent or misrepresented properties
- Damage to platform trust and reputation
- Increased customer service costs
- Legal and regulatory compliance issues

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Machine Learning Models

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**
   - Provides interpretable decision rules
   - Handles both categorical and numerical features
   - Efficient for real-time prediction

2. **Random Forest Classifier**
   - Ensemble method for improved accuracy
   - Handles overfitting better than single decision trees
   - Provides feature importance rankings

3. **Logistic Regression**
   - Probabilistic predictions
   - Fast training and prediction
   - Good baseline model for comparison

### Feature Engineering

The system analyzes multiple risk signals including:
- **Host Profile Features**: Account age, verification status, response rate
- **Listing Characteristics**: Price anomalies, photo quality, description patterns
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Template messaging, duplicate content detection
- **Review Analysis**: Review patterns, sentiment analysis, fake review detection
- **Geographic Signals**: Location accuracy, property type consistency

## 📊 Dataset

The project utilizes comprehensive Airbnb listing data including:
- Property details and descriptions
- Host information and history
- Review data and ratings
- Pricing and availability information
- Geographic and location data
